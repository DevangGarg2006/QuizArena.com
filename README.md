# 🎯 QuizArena

**QuizArena** is a sleek and interactive quiz web app built with React, designed to challenge your knowledge across a variety of topics (like History, General Knowledge, Animals, and Sports). It fetches real-time trivia questions from the [Open Trivia Database](https://opentdb.com/) API, offering a dynamic and engaging experience for users.

> 🛠️ **Note from the Developer**  
> This is my **first React project**, which I proudly built myself as part of my learning journey. I did take a bit of help from **ChatGPT** and a few online resources like **YouTube**, but I fully understand each and every line of code in this project. It reflects my hands-on learning and growing confidence in frontend development.
